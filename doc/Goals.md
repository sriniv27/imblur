# Goals

The `imblur` project aims to be a needlessly heavy-handed way to blur an image so that I can pass it to my screen-locker. Less tongue-in-cheek (and in no particular order), I also hope to sharpen my modern C++, experiment with code-documentation integration, try out development environment customization, and leverage CI to build and test my code.
 
## Required
- Blur an image 
- Practise Modern C++
- Consistently Document the project
  - Usage
  - Development
- Leverage CI To Build And Test My Code.

## Nice to have
- Experiment With Code-Documentation Integration
- Try Out Development Environment Customization
